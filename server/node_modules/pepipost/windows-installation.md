# Getting started with Pepipost API on windows 
Installing SDK on windows Server with Integrated Development Enviroment(IDE)

These steps are dedicated to those who ❤️ to code on IDE.

> Optional Note: This library will be sending HTTP calls to Pepipost server and hence if you're running any firewalls on your machine, then please whitelist the API base URL ```api.pepipost.com``` with ```port 443/80```

# Installation steps

The generated SDK relies on [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/) (NPM) being available to resolve dependencies. If you don't already have NPM installed, please go ahead and follow instructions to install NPM from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
The SDK also requires Node to be installed. If Node isn't already installed, please install it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
> NPM is installed by default when Node is installed

To check if node and npm have been successfully installed, write the following commands in command prompt:

* `node --version`
* `npm -version`

![Version Check](https://apidocs.io/illustration/nodejs?step=versionCheck&workspaceFolder=pepipost-Node)

Now use npm to resolve all dependencies by running the following command in the root directory (of the SDK folder):

```bash
npm install
```

![Resolve Dependencies](https://apidocs.io/illustration/nodejs?step=resolveDependency1&workspaceFolder=pepipost-Node)

![Resolve Dependencies](https://apidocs.io/illustration/nodejs?step=resolveDependency2)

This will install all dependencies in the `node_modules` folder.

Once dependencies are resolved, you will need to move the folder `PepipostLib ` in to your `node_modules` folder.

## How to Use

The following section explains how to use the library in a new project.

### 1. Open Project Folder
Open an IDE/Text Editor for JavaScript like Sublime Text. The basic workflow presented here is also applicable if you prefer using a different editor or IDE.

Click on `File` and select `Open Folder`.

![Open Folder](https://apidocs.io/illustration/nodejs?step=openFolder)

Select the folder of your SDK and click on `Select Folder` to open it up in Sublime Text. The folder will become visible in the bar on the left.

### 2. Creating a Test File

Now right click on the folder name and select the `New File` option to create a new test file. Save it as `index.js` Now import the generated NodeJS library using the following lines of code:

```js
var lib = require('lib');
```

copy the [example.js](https://github.com/pepipost/pepipost-sdk-nodejs/blob/master/example.js) file and make neccessary changes.

Save changes.

![Create new file](https://apidocs.io/illustration/nodejs?step=createNewFile&workspaceFolder=pepipost-Node)

![Save new file](https://apidocs.io/illustration/nodejs?step=saveNewFile&workspaceFolder=pepipost-Node)

### 3. Running The Test File

To run the `index.js` file, open up the command prompt and navigate to the Path where the SDK folder resides. Type the following command to run the file:

```
node index.js
```
